# Age Detection
The Age Detection project utilizes images from "The Indian Actors" dataset. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, the project aims to classify the age of actors into two categories: young and old.

Using advanced deep learning techniques, the system analyzes facial features and patterns within the images to accurately determine the age group of the actors depicted. Using CNN models, the project achieves precise age classification, contributing to the development of robust image recognition systems.
